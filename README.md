# Mitigating depression with clinical support systems using network models

## Abstract
Major Depressive Disorder is a significant global health issue characterized by
depressed mood, impaired cognitive function, and disturbed sleep or appetite.
This thesis aims to analyze the impact of social support on depression symptoms
using network model and to personalize social support in depression treatment
with real-time data from wearable devices.
By applying network theory, I model social support and design simulation experiments
to analyzed social support effects on depressive symptoms.

The results revealed three key findings:
1. Social support, while not always reducing immediate depressive scores, 
significantly lowers the risk of relapse over time, highlighting its long-term benefits.
2. Increased connection probabilities can increase social support,
reducing depressive symptoms, though this effect is nonlinear
due to a maximum number connections that an individual can sustain.
3. The impact of social support on depression is significantly influenced by
the coefficients of family and friend support in the regression model estimating depression
and specific values of the coefficient can indicate when social support
can effectively reduce depressive symptoms.

These insights underscore the importance of personalized social support interventions
and provide a framework for utilizing network models in intervention
and mental health monitoring system.
